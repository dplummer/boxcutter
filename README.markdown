# Ruby Wrapper for BlueBoxGroup API

This ruby library consumes the BlueBoxGroup APIs.

Currently supported:

 - [Load Balancing](https://boxpanel.bluebox.net/public/the_vault/index.php/Load_Balancing_API)
 - [Servers](https://boxpanel.bluebox.net/public/the_vault/index.php/Servers_API)

## Example Usage

You need to specify your `BBG_API_KEY` in your environment first.

```bash
$ export BBG_API_KEY=123456:abcdefg
```

Where `123456` is your customer id and `abcdefg` is your api key. See
the [Optain your api
key](https://boxpanel.bluebox.net/public/the_vault/index.php/Load_Balancing_API#Step_1:_Obtain_your_API_Key)
section for more information.

Then load up the API in irb:

```ruby
$ irb -r './lib/boxcutter'
1.9.3p194 :001 > apps = Boxcutter::LoadBalancer::Application.all
 => [#<Application id:'88888888-cccc-4444-8888-dddddddddddd' name:'example.com' ip_v4:'192.168.1.1' ip_v6:'::1'>]
```

Command-line script to remove a machine from a load balancer.

```bash
$ ./bin/remove_machine.rb -h
Options:
   --backend, -b <s>:   Service backend name (default: default)
   --hostname, -n <s>:  Machine hostname to remove
   --dryrun, -d:        Don't actually remove the server from the backend
   --help, -h:          Show this message
```

Command-line script to add a machine to a load balancer. This script
assumes you have two services, one for http and one for https. It will
add the machine to each service, but with the port set to 80.

```bash
$ ./bin/add_machine.rb -h
Options:
   --backend, -b <s>:   Service backend name (default: default)
   --hostname, -n <s>:  Machine hostname to remove
   --dryrun, -d:        Don't actually remove the server from the backend
   --help, -h:          Show this message
```

This is definately a work in progress. The goal is to use this wrapper
to add and remove servers from the load balancer during a deploy for
zero downtime.
